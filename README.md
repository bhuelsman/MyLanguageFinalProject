### Unary Minus Code Checking
Correctly implements unary minus(ensure variable is defined before or else will not evaluate with intended value)

print -(x+1)
y:= 5
print -(y+3)
```
### Basic Type Checking
Outputs an error with mismatched types and an operation
```
print(1==true)
print(1+hello)
print(hello+1)
print(1/0)
```
### Sorting List Checking
Can be done with any length of list of integers
```
print(sort [1,6,3,8,9])
print(quicksort [5,3,8,9,1,6,3,2])
```
### Indexing List Checking
Can be done with any length of list. Can also check if trying to access out of bounds and stops program if it is
```
y := [4,7,2,8,0]
print(y[3])
print(y[6])
```
